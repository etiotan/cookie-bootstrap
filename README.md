# Cookie Cutter

**Synopsis**

A cookie cutter Bootstrap page, the type of page everyone sees. It's clean it's standard and it looks like every other Bootstrap template out there. This is an alteration of this page https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer/blob/master/index.html

**Challenges**

Understanding, Bootstrap, the grid system, the modals.

**Solution**

To be honest all it took was some time, tinkering, and a few Youtube videos to figure it out. Bootstrap wasn't that hard after all. 

**Tools**

Less, Bootstrap

**Motivation**

Although I used Bootstrap when I first started coding, I eventually dropped it because I wanted to learn vanilla CSS and understand it. Many companies do use Bootstrap and it isn't the most difficult to learn, so I felt I should do a project with it.
